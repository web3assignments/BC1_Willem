For this application key management is not extremely important an no money is being transferred.
However a degree of key management is alway recommended. It is never favourable for contracts to be accessible for everyone.
I would recommend writing the key on a piece of paper and keeping it somewhere safe.
To be sure it is also possible to giva a hardcopy of the key to someone you trust.
